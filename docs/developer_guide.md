## Architecture Overview

The platform is built using a modern microservices architecture, allowing for scalability and flexibility. Key components include:

- **Frontend**: Developed with React and TypeScript, providing a responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express power the backend, using microservices for different functionalities.
- **Database**: Utilizes MongoDB for data storage and Redis for caching.
- **AI Models**: Integrated with various AI models for enhanced analytics and automation.

## Setup and Installation

### System Requirements

Ensure your system meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Linux, macOS, or Windows
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **MongoDB**: Version 4.x
- **Redis**: Version 6.x

### Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/no-code-builder.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` and `backend` directories and run `npm install`.
3. **Configure Environment**: Set up environment variables in the `.env` file (refer to the `env.example` for guidance).

### Environment Configuration

Configure the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```plaintext
# Example .env file

NODE_ENV=production
APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

## Core Modules

### Backend Services

The backend is composed of various microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities:

- **Auth Service**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Chat Service**: Handles user interactions and processes chat commands.
- **AI Service**: Integrates and manages AI models for analytics and automation.

## Extending the Platform

### Plugin Development

Developers can create custom plugins to extend the platform's capabilities. Follow these steps to create a plugin:

1. **Create a New Plugin**: Implement your plugin logic in a new directory under the `plugins` folder.
2. **Register the Plugin**: Add your plugin to the `pluginRegistry.json` file.
3. **Test and Deploy**: Ensure your plugin functions correctly and deploy it to the platform.

## Deployment and CI/CD

### Deployment Guide

Deploy the platform using the provided deployment scripts. Ensure all services are running and configured correctly.

### CI/CD Pipelines

Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment. Use tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions for integration.
